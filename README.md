- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nibblenobble, well That's not my real name.  I have other names.  My real name is a variable encapsulating my many states of beingness.  
- 👀 I’m interested in programming.  I did a little programming in university back in early 2000's as part of my studies.  Java was the flavor of the day.  20 years later,
in search of a hobby, I took up objective C as I had dreams of developing apps.  I then moved over to Swift as it was supposed to be easy.  Now, I am learning Python.  Like really,
where was this programming language when I started.  For mathematics it's muuuuuuuuch easier.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on . . . well github, I don't know yet.  I was told this is where I need to be if I'm going to program.  I also heard it was complicated.  I can't 
learn it unless I do it, so here I am doing it.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I am guessing there is a way to do that here.
